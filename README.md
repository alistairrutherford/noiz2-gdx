Noiz2 - Vector Shoot Em Up

This is my original port of Kenta Chos esoteric shooter converted to use LibGDX and my netthreads-libgdx extensions library.

It's very much a work in progress. The preferences and difficulty levels are not persisted yet.

A word of warning, Kentas code is completely impossible to follow. My orignal contribution  was to rewrite the bulletml parser and abstract the drawing primitives so you can actually port this to varying platforms.

Now that I have ported it over to use LibGDX it brings some nice additions such as the moving star background and the sliding transitions between screens.
